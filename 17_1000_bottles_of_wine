# The King of a small country invites 1000 senators to his annual party.
# As a tradition, each senator brings the King a bottle of wine. Soon
# after, the Queen discovers that one of the senators is trying to
# assassinate the King by giving him a bottle of poisoned wine.
# Unfortunately, they do not know which senator, nor which bottle of wine
# is poisoned, and the poison is completely indiscernible.
# However, the King has 10 lab rats. He decides to use them as taste
# testers to determine which bottle of wine contains the poison. The poison
# when taken has no effect on the rats, until exactly 24 hours later when
# the infected rats suddenly die. The King needs to determine which bottle
# of wine is poisoned by tomorrow, so that the festivities can continue as
# planned.
# Hence he only has time for one round of testing, he decides that each rat
# tastes multiple bottles, according to a certain scheme.
