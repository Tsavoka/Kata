# The construction of the new Death Star is almost complete. It only
# needs a certain amount of 3 materials â€“ iron, steel, and chromium.
# The emperor wants the construction finished within a week because he
# senses an impending rebel attack and knows the battle station will be
# destroyed if it is not completed within this timeframe. He has
# already ordered enough material delivered to the station within a
# week. The problem is, the rebels are attacking the supply routes and
# there are different amounts of material arriving at the station each
# week. Will the station be ready in time or will it be destroyed?
# The required resources are:
# 100 Gt of iron
# 75 Gt of steel
# 50 Gt of chromium
# The input will consist of an array with 8 elements:
# The first 7 elements are the shipments - 3-elements-long arrays where
# each number corresponds to the amount of material that was ordered
# (iron, steel, and chromium)
# The last element is a number representing the day of the rebel
# attack (0-indexed) - any materials which should have been delivered
# that day will be lost, and later shipments will be cancelled due to
# the trading route becoming unsafe
# The output will be one of the two possible string:
# In case enough resources were delivered before the attack, return
# "The station is completed!"
# Otherwise, return "The station is destroyed! It needed X iron, Y steel
# and Z chromium for completion.", where X, Y and Z are the quantities
# of the respective material
