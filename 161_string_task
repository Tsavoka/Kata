# The program was supposed to do the following: in the given string,
# consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, it:
# - deletes all the vowels,
# - inserts a character "." before each consonant,
# - replaces all uppercase consonants with corresponding lowercase ones.
#â€‚Vowels are letters "A", "O", "Y", "E", "U", "I", and the rest are
# consonants. The program's input is exactly one string, it should return
# the output as a single string, resulting after the program's processing
# the initial string.
