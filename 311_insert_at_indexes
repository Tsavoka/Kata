# Description:
# Dear Coder,
# We at [SomeLargeCompany] have decided to expand on the functionality of
# our online text editor.
# We have written a new function that accepts a phrase, a word and an
# array of indexes. We want this function to return the phrase, with the
# word inserted at each of the indexes given by the array.
# However, our current function only gets the first insertion right, but
# all of the following ones are out of place!
# Please fix this for us, and you will be showered with money.
# Yours Sincerely, [SomeLargeCompany]
# Note :
# the indicies are always in range and passed as a sorted array
# note if the index array is empty, just return the initial phrase

def insert_at_indexes(phrase, word, indexes):
    phrase = list(phrase)
    cycle = 0
    for i in indexes:
        phrase.insert(i+cycle, word)
        cycle += 1
    return ''.join(phrase)




print(insert_at_indexes("I like codewars! It makes me happy."," really",[1, 28]))
# 'I really like codewars! It makes me really happy.',
print(insert_at_indexes('I really like codewars! It makes me really happy.',"'d",[1, 26])) 
# "I'd really like codewars! It'd makes me really happy.",
print(insert_at_indexes("'I' write a wi said Phi", "ll", [3, 14, 24])) 
# "'I'll write a will said Phill"
