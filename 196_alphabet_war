# There is a war and nobody knows - the alphabet war!
# There are two groups of hostile letters. The tension between left
# side letters and right side letters was too high and the war began.
# Write a function that accepts fight string consists of only small
# letters and return who wins the fight. When the left side wins return
# Left side wins!, when the right side wins return Right side wins!,
# in other case return Let's fight again!.
# The left side letters and their power:
#  w - 4, p - 3, b - 2, s - 1
# The right side letters and their power:
# m - 4, q - 3, d - 2, z - 1
# The other letters don't have power and are only victims.
