# In this kata you are given a string for example:
# "example(unwanted thing)example"
# Your task is to remove everything inside the parentheses as well as
# the parentheses themselves.
# The example above would return:
# "exampleexample"
# Notes
# Other than parentheses only letters and spaces can occur in the string.
# Don't worry about other brackets like "[]" and "{}" as these will never
# appear.
# There can be multiple parentheses.
# The parentheses can be nested.
