# Winter is coming, you must prepare your ski holidays. The objective of
# this kata is to determine the number of pair of gloves you can constitute
# from the gloves you have in your drawer.
# Given an array describing the color of each glove, return the number of
# pairs you can constitute, assuming that only gloves of the same color can
# form pairs.
# Examples:
# input = ["red", "green", "red", "blue", "blue"]
# result = 2 (1 red pair + 1 blue pair)
