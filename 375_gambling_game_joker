# Popular gambling game Joker consists of drawing 6 balls from a drum on
# which are written numbers between 1 and 45. The winning joker number is
# formed from the drawn numbers so that in the same order in which the balls
# are drawn, we write down their last digits.
# For example, if the numbers 12, 35, 1, 2, 23 and 39 are drawn in order,
# then it is a joker No. 251239.
# 1[2], 3[5], [1], [2], 2[3], 3[9] --> 251239
# Players buy winning tickets and look forward to drawing and calculating
# the joker number to calculate their possible gain. The winnings of the
# ticket are calculated by comparing the serial number written on the ticket
# with the calculated joker number in a way to count how many last digits of
# these two numbers match, as shown in the following table.
# Serial No. | Name of prize
# -----------+---------------
# 251239     |   I type
# X51239     |   II type
# XX1239     |   III type
# XXX239     |   IV type
# XXXX39     |   V type
# XXXXX9     |   Losing card
# XXXXXX     |   Losing card
# In the left column are the serial numbers of the tickets, where X denotes
# arbitrary digits. In the right column of the table are the winnings names
# for each of the serial number forms. So if the serial number is exactly
# equal to the Joker number then we get the gain of type I, if the last 5
# digits are equal we get the gain of type II, and so on, until the gain of
# type V, the kind we get when the last two digits are equal. All other
# serials are not winning.
# Write a program that will return the names of the winnings for a given
# Joker number and given tickets. The names of the winnings must be written
# exactly as written in the table above (the number of winnings is written
# in Roman numbers with capital letters ‘I’ and ‘V’, followed by a space
# and lowercase letters ‘type’).
# some tickets may have leading zeros
# some joker numbers may have leading zeros
# leading zeros still count towards the total
