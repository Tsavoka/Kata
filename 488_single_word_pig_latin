# Pig Latin is an English language game where the goal is to hide the
# meaning of a word from people not aware of the rules.
# So, the goal of this kata is to wite a function that encodes a single
# word string to pig latin.
# The rules themselves are rather easy:
# The word starts with a vowel(a,e,i,o,u) -> return the original string
# plus "way".
# The word starts with a consonant -> move consonants from the beginning
# of the word to the end of the word until the first vowel, then return it
# plus "ay".
# The result must be lowercase, regardless of the case of the input. If the
# input string has any non-alpha characters, the function must return None,
# null, Nothing (depending on the language).
# The function must also handle simple random strings and not just English
# words.
# The input string has no vowels -> return the original string plus "ay".
# For example, the word "spaghetti" becomes "aghettispay" because the first
# two letters ("sp") are consonants, so they are moved to the end of the
# string and "ay" is appended.
