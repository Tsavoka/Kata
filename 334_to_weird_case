# Write a function toWeirdCase (weirdcase in Ruby) that accepts a
# string, and returns the same string with all even indexed characters
# in each word upper cased, and all odd indexed characters in each
# word lower cased. The indexing just explained is zero based, so the
# zero-ith index is even, therefore that character should be upper cased
# and you need to start over for each word.
# The passed in string will only consist of alphabetical characters and
# spaces(' '). Spaces will only be present if there are multiple words.
# Words will be separated by a single space(' ').

def to_weird_case(string):
    string = string.split()
    rez = []
    for i in string:
        while i:
            rez.append(i[:2].capitalize())
            i = i[2:]
        rez.append(' ')
    return ''.join(rez).strip()




print(to_weird_case('This'))            # 'ThIs'
print(to_weird_case('is'))              # 'Is'
print(to_weird_case('This is a test'))  # 'ThIs Is A TeSt'
