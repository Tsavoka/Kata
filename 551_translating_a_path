# You are a robot.
# As a robot, you are programmed to take walks following a path.
# The path is input to you as a string of the following characters where:
# "^" -> step up
# "v" -> step down
# ">" -> step right
# "<" -> step left
# For example, a valid path would look like:
# "^^vv>><<^v>"
# However, you are a robot that cannot understand this string of characters
# just by looking at it. You need detailed instructions on how to follow
# the path.
# Your objective is to write a program to translate the input path to a set
# of detailed and readable instructions that even a robot like you could
# understand.
# To do this, you must translate the previous example
# "^^vvvv>><<^v>"
# to a "line feed separated string" equivalent to:
#  Take 2 steps up
#  Take 4 steps down
#  Take 2 steps right
#  Take 2 steps left
#  Take 1 step up
#  Take 1 step down
#  Take 1 step right
# Notice that groups of the same characters translate to one instruction
# only, telling you to take multiple steps.
# Notes:
#  The input path will NEVER contain invalid characters, only the four
# characters for the directions.
#  The instruction lines are separated only by a newline ("\n") character.
# This character is not present at the beginning of the first instruction
# line nor at the end of the last instruction line.
#  An empty path with no characters should output a "Paused" string meaning
# that you, the robot, are not supposed to move anywhere and are in a paused
# state.
