# The code provided has a method hello which is supposed to show only those
# attributes which have been explicitly set. Furthermore, it is supposed to
# say them in the same order they were set.
# But it's not working properly.
# Notes
# There are 3 attributes
# name
# age
# sex ('M' or 'F')
# When the same attribute is assigned multiple times the hello method shows
# it only once. If this happens the order depends on the first assignment of
# that attribute, but the value is from the last assignment.
# Examples
# Hello.
# Hello. My name is Bob. I am 27. I am male.
# Hello. I am 27. I am male. My name is Bob.
# Hello. My name is Alice. I am female.
# Hello. My name is Batman.
# Task
# Fix the code so we can all go home early.
