# Your task in order to complete this Kata is to write a function which
# formats a duration, given as a number of seconds, in a human-friendly way.
# The function must accept a non-negative integer. If it is zero, it just
# returns "now". Otherwise, the duration is expressed as a combination of
# years, days, hours, minutes and seconds.
# It is much easier to understand with an example:
# * For seconds = 62, your function should return 
#     "1 minute and 2 seconds"
# * For seconds = 3662, your function should return
#     "1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds"
# For the purpose of this Kata, a year is 365 days and a day is 24 hours.
# Note that spaces are important.
# Detailed rules
# The resulting expression is made of components like 4 seconds, 1 year,
# etc. In general, a positive integer and one of the valid units of time,
# separated by a space. The unit of time is used in plural if the integer
# is greater than 1.
# The components are separated by a comma and a space (", "). Except the
# last component, which is separated by " and ", just like it would be
# written in English.
# A more significant units of time will occur before than a least significant
# one. Therefore, 1 second and 1 year is not correct, but 1 year and 1 second
# is.
# Different components have different unit of times. So there is not
# repeated units like in 5 seconds and 1 second.
# A component will not appear at all if its value happens to be zero. Hence,
# 1 minute and 0 seconds is not valid, but it should be just 1 minute.
# A unit of time must be used "as much as possible". It means that the
# function should not return 61 seconds, but 1 minute and 1 second instead.
# Formally, the duration specified by of a component must not be greater than
# any valid more significant unit of time.
