# The Hamming Distance is a measure of similarity between two strings of
# equal length. Complete the function so that it returns the number of
# positions where the input strings do not match.
# Examples:
# a = "I like turtles"
# b = "I like turkeys"
# Result: 3
# You can assume that the two input strings are of equal length.

    return sum(i!=k for i,k in zip(a,b))

print(hamming("a man a plan a canal","a man a plan sobanal"))           # 3
print(hamming("hamming and cheese","Hamming and Cheese"))               # 2
print(hamming("espresso","Expresso"))                                   # 2
