# It's March and you just can't seem to get your mind off brackets.
# However, it is not due to basketball. You need to extract statements
# within strings that are contained within brackets.
# You have to write a function that returns a list of statements that
# are contained within brackets given a string. If the value entered in
# the function is not a string, well, you know where that variable should
# be sitting.
