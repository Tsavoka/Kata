# Normally we have firstname, middle and the last name but there may be
# more than one word in a name like a South Indian one.
# Similar to those kinda names we need to initialize the names.
# See the pattern below:
# initials('code wars') => returns C.Wars 
# initials('Barack Hussain obama') => returns B.H.Obama 
# Complete the function initials.
# Names are separated by exactly one space in the input, without leading or
# trailing spaces. Names will always be lowercase, except optionally their
# first letter.

def initials(name):
    name = name.title().split()
    return ''.join(i[0]+'.' for i in name[:-1]) + name[-1]
    



print(initials('code wars'))                # 'C.Wars'
print(initials('Barack hussein obama'))     # 'B.H.Obama'
print(initials('barack hussein Obama'))     # 'B.H.Obama'
