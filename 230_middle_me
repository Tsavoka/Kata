# Write a function that will take a key of X and place it in the
# middle of Y repeated N times.
# Extra challege (not tested): You can complete this with under
# 70 characters without using regex. Challenge yourself to do this.
# It wont be best practices but it will work.
# If X cannot be placed in the middle, return X.
# N will always be > 0.
