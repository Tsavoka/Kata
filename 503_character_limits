# Cara is applying for several different jobs. The online application forms
# ask her to respond within a specific character count. Cara needs to check
# that her answers fit into the character limit.
# Annoyingly, some application forms count spaces as a character, and some
# don't.
# Your challenge:
# Write Cara a function charCheck() with the arguments:
# "text": a string containing Cara's answer for the question
# "max": a number equal to the maximum number of characters allowed in the
# answer
# "spaces": a boolean which is True if spaces are included in the character
# count and False if they are not
# The function charCheck() should return an array: [True, "Answer"] , where
# "Answer" is equal to the original text, if Cara's answer is short enough.
# If her answer "text" is too long, return an array: [False, "Answer"]. The
# second element should be the original "text" string truncated to the length
# of the limit.
# When the "spaces" argument is False, you should remove the spaces from the
# "Answer".

def charCheck(text, mx, spaces):
    if spaces:
        return [len(text) <= mx, text[0:mx]]
    else:
        text = ''.join(text.split())
        return [len(text) <= mx, text[0:mx]]
