# Welcome to the Codewars Bar!
# Codewars Bar recommends you drink 1 glass of water per standard drink 
# so you're not hungover tomorrow morning.
# Your fellow coders have bought you several drinks tonight in the form 
# of a string. Return a string suggesting how many glasses of water you 
# should drink to not be hungover.
