# 1. You are to write an function that takes a string as it's first paramter.
# This string will be a string of words.
# 2. You are expected to then use the second parameter, which will be an
# integer, to find the corresponding word in the given string. The first
# word would be represented by 0.
# 3. Once you have the located string you are finally going to multiply by
# it the third provided paramater, which will also be an interger. You are
# additionally required to add a hyphen in between each word.
# modify_multiply ("This is a string",3,5) 
# Should return
# "string-string-string-string-string"
# Since the 3rd word is 'string'(starting from 0 remember) and the third
# paramater indicates that it should be repeated 5 times.
# Simple. Good luck.
