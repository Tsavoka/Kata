# Remember the spongebob meme that is meant to make fun of people by
# repeating what they say in a mocking way?
# You need to create a function that converts the input into this format,
# with the output being the same string expect there is a pattern of
# uppercase and lowercase letters.
# Example:
# input:  "stop Making spongebob Memes!"
# output: "StOp mAkInG SpOnGeBoB MeMeS!"
