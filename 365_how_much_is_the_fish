# How much is the fish! (- Scooter )
# The ocean is full of colorful fishes. We as programmers want to know
# the hexadecimal value of these fishes.
# Take all hexadecimal valid characters (a,b,c,d,e,f) of the given name
# and XOR them. Return the result as an integer.
# The input is always a string, which can contain spaces, upper and lower
# case letters but no digits.
# fisHex("redlionfish") -> e,d,f -> XOR -> 12
