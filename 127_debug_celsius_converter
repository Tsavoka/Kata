# Debug celsius converter
# Your friend is traveling abroad to the United States so he wrote a
# program to convert fahrenheit to celsius. Unfortunately his code has
# some bugs.
# Find the errors in the code to get the celsius converter working
# properly.
# To convert fahrenheit to celsius:
# celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9)
# Remember that typically temperatures in the current weather conditions
# are given in whole numbers.

def weather_info(temp):
    c = convert_to_celsius(temp)
    if c < 0:
        return(str(c) + " is freezing temperature")
    else:
        return(str(c) + " is above freezing temperature")
    
def convert_to_celsius(temperature):
    celsius = (temperature - 32) * (5/9)
    return celsius




print(weather_info(50))     # '10.0 is above freezing temperature'
print(weather_info(23))     # '-5.0 is freezing temperature'
