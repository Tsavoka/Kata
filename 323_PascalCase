# You must create a method that can convert a string from any
# format into PascalCase. This must support symbols too.
# Don't presume the separators too much or you could be surprised.
# For example: (Input --> Output)
# "example name" --> "ExampleName"
# "your-NaMe-here" --> "YourNameHere"
# "testing ABC" --> "TestingAbc"
