# For "x", determine how many positive integers less than or
# equal to "x" are odd but not prime. Assume "x" is an integer
# between 1 and 10000.
# Example: 5 has three odd numbers (1,3,5) and only the number
# 1 is not prime, so the answer is 1
# Example: 10 has five odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9) and only 1 and 9
# are not prime, so the answer is 2
