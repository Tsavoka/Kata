# Let's pretend your company just hired your friend from college and
# paid you a referral bonus. Awesome! To celebrate, you're taking your
# team out to the terrible dive bar next door and using the referral
# bonus to buy, and build, the largest three-dimensional beer can
# pyramid you can. And then probably drink those beers, because let's
# pretend it's Friday too.
# A beer can pyramid will square the number of cans in each level - 1
# can in the top level, 4 in the second, 9 in the next, 16, 25...
# Complete the beeramid function to return the number of complete
# levels of a beer can pyramid you can make, given the parameters of:
# 1) your referral bonus, and
# 2) the price of a beer can
