# You are Saitama (a.k.a One Punch Man), and you are fighting against the
# monsters! You are strong enough to kill them with one punch, but after
# you punch 3 times, one of the remaining monsters will hit you once.
# Your health is health; number of monsters is monsters, damage that monster
# can give you is damage.
# Write a function that will calculate:
# how many hits you received, how much damage you received and your remaining
# health.
# if your health is <= 0, you die and function should return "hero died".
# Examples
# killMonsters(100, 3, 33); // => "hits: 0, damage: 0, health: 100"
# killMonsters(50, 7, 10); // => "hits: 2, damage: 20, health: 30"
