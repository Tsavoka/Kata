# You need to create a function, helloWorld, that will return the String
# Hello, World! without actually using raw strings. This includes quotes,
# double quotes and template strings. You can, however, use the String
# constructor and any related functions.
# You cannot use the following:
# "Hello, World!"
# 'Hello, World!'
# `Hello, World!`
# Good luck and try to be as creative as possible!

from string import printable as pt


def hello_world():
    return pt[43]+pt[14]+pt[21]+pt[21]+pt[24]+pt[73]+pt[94]+pt[58]+pt[24]+pt[27]+pt[21]+pt[13]+pt[62]




print(hello_world())    # 'Hello, World!'
