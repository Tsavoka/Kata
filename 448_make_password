# One suggestion to build a satisfactory password is to start with a
# memorable phrase or sentence and make a password by extracting the
# first letter of each word.
# Even better is to replace some of those letters with numbers (e.g.,
# the letter O can be replaced with the number 0):
# - instead of including i or I put the number 1 in the password;
# - instead of including o or O put the number 0 in the password;
# - instead of including s or S put the number 5 in the password.
# Examples:
# "Give me liberty or give me death"  --> "Gml0gmd"
# "Keep Calm and Carry On"            --> "KCaC0"

def make_password(phrase):
    return ''.join(i[0] for i in phrase.split()).translate(str.maketrans('iIoOsS', '110055'))




print(make_password("Give me liberty or give me death"))    # "Gml0gmd"
print(make_password("Keep Calm and Carry On"))              # "KCaC0"
