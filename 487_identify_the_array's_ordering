# Write a function that takes a single array as an argument (containing
# multiple strings and/or positive numbers and/or arrays), and returns one
# of four possible string values, depending on the ordering of the lengths
# of the elements in the input array:
# Your function should return...
# “Increasing” - if the lengths of the elements increase from left to right
# (although it is possible that some neighbouring elements may also be equal
# in length)
# “Decreasing” - if the lengths of the elements decrease from left to right
# (although it is possible that some neighbouring elements may also be equal
# in length)
# “Unsorted” - if the lengths of the elements fluctuate from left to right
# “Constant” - if all element's lengths are the same.
# Numbers and Strings should be evaluated based on the number of characters
# or digits used to write them.
# Arrays should be evaluated based on the number of elements counted directly
# in the parent array (but not the number of elements contained in any
# sub-arrays).
