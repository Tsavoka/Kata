# Given a string, return a copy of the string with the vowels' case
# swapped.
# For this kata, assume that vowels are in the set "aeouiAEOUI".
# Example: Given a string "C is alive!", your function should return "C
# Is AlIvE!"
# Addendum: Your solution is only required to work for the ASCII character
# set.
# Please make sure you only swap cases for the vowels.
