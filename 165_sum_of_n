# In this kata, we will be using a more complicated sequence: 0, 1, 3,
# 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ... This sequence is generated with the pattern:
# "the nth term is the sum of numbers from 0 to n, inclusive".
# Complete the function that takes an integer n and returns a list/array
# of length abs(n) + 1 of the arithmetic series explained above. When
# n < 0 return the sequence with negative terms.

from itertools import accumulate
from math import copysign


def sum_of_n(n):
    acc_list = accumulate(range(0, abs(n)+1))
    return [int(copysign(a, n)) for a in acc_list]




print(sum_of_n(3))      # [0, 1, 3, 6])
print(sum_of_n(1))      # [0, 1])
print(sum_of_n(0))      # [0])
print(sum_of_n(-4))     # [0, -1, -3, -6, -10])
