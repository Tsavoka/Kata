#   count 1 ruby everytime you see a r and 2 everytime you see a R

#  If the girl have met the evil fairy:
#   count 1 python everytime you see a p and 2 everytime uou see a P
#   count 1 squirrel everytime you see a s and 2 everytime you see a S
# Note: For this kata I decided to remplace the normal Diamonds and Toads by
