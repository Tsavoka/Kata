# There is a war and nobody knows - the alphabet war!
# There are two groups of hostile letters. The tension between left side
# letters and right side letters was too high and the war began. The letters
# called airstrike to help them in war - dashes and dots are spreaded
# everywhere on the battlefield.
# Task
# Write a function that accepts fight string consists of only small letters
# and * which means a bomb drop place. Return who wins the fight after bombs
# are exploded. When the left side wins return Left side wins!, when the
# right side wins return Right side wins!, in other case return Let's fight
# again!.
# The left side letters and their power:
#  w - 4
#  p - 3 
#  b - 2
#  s - 1
# The right side letters and their power:
#  m - 4
#  q - 3 
#  d - 2
#  z - 1
# The other letters don't have power and are only victims.
# The * bombs kill the adjacent letters ( i.e. aa*aa => a___a, **aa**
# => ______ );
# Example
# AlphabetWar("s*zz");           //=> Right side wins!
# AlphabetWar("*zd*qm*wp*bs*"); //=> Let's fight again!
# AlphabetWar("zzzz*s*");       //=> Right side wins!
# AlphabetWar("www*www****z");  //=> Left side wins!
