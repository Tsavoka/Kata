# Create a function that will return a string that combines all of the 
# letters of the three inputed strings in groups. Taking the first letter 
# of all of the inputs and grouping them next to each other. Do this for 
# every letter, see example below!
# Ex: Input: "aa", "bb" , "cc" => Output: "abcabc"

print(triple_trouble("burn", "reds", "roll"))     # "brrueordlnsl"
print(triple_trouble("Bm", "aa", "tn"))           # "Batman"
