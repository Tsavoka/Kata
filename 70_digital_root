# In this kata, you must create a digital root function.
# A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.
# Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than
# one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number
# is produced. This is only applicable to the natural numbers.

from functools import reduce


def digital_root(n):
    while n > 9:
        n = reduce(lambda x,y: int(x) + int(y), list(str(n)))
    return n




print(digital_root(16))     # 7 
print(digital_root(456))    # 6
