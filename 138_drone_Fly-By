# The other day I saw an amazing video where a guy hacked some 
# wifi controlled lightbulbs by flying a drone past them. Brilliant.
# In this kata we will recreate that stunt... sort of.
# You will be given two strings: lamps and drone. lamps represents a 
# row of lamps, currently off, each represented by x. When these lamps 
# are on, they should be represented by o.
# The drone string represents the position of the drone T (any better 
# suggestion for character??) and its flight path up until this 
# point =. The drone always flies left to right, and always begins at 
# the start of the row of lamps. Anywhere the drone has flown, 
# including its current position, will result in the lamp at that 
# position switching on.
# Return the resulting lamps string. See example tests for more
# clarity.

def fly_by(lamps, drone):
    return '{}{}'.format('o'*len(drone), 'x'*(len(lamps)-len(drone))) \
    if len(lamps)>len(drone) else '{}'.format('o'*len(lamps))
    
    


print(fly_by('xxxxxx', '====T'))                # 'ooooox'
print(fly_by('xxxxxxxxx', '==T'))               # 'oooxxxxxx'
print(fly_by('xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx', '=========T'))  # 'ooooooooooxxxxx'
