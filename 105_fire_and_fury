# Kata Task
# Decipher the tweet by looking for words with known meanings.
# FIRE = *"You are fired!"*
# FURY = *"I am furious."*
# If no known words are found, or unexpected letters are encountered,
# then it must be a *"Fake tweet."*
# Notes
# The tweet reads left-to-right.
# Any letters not spelling words FIRE or FURY are just ignored
# If multiple of the same words are found in a row then plural rules
# apply -
# FIRE x 1 = *"You are fired!"*
# FIRE x 2 = *"You and you are fired!"*
# FIRE x 3 = *"You and you and you are fired!"*
# FURY x 1 = *"I am furious."*
# FURY x 2 = *"I am really furious."*
# FURY x 3 = *"I am really really furious."*
# The only letters still working are uppercase E, F, I, R, U, Y.
