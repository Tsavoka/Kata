# In this Kata, we will calculate running pace. To do that, we have to know
# the distance and the time.
# Create the following function:
# running_pace(distance, time)
# Where: distance - A float with the number of kilometres
# time - A string containing the time it took to travel the distance. It
# will always be minutes:seconds. For example "25:00" means 25 minutes.
# You don't have to deal with hours.
# The function should return the pace, for example "4:20" means it took 4
# minutes and 20 seconds to travel one kilometre.
# Note: The pace should always return only the number of minutes and seconds.
# You don't have to convert these into hours. Floor the number of seconds.

def running_pace(distance, time):
    time = time.split(':')
    time = int(time[0])*60 + int(time[1])
    return '{}:{}'.format(int((time/distance)//60), str(int((time/distance)%60)).zfill(2))




print(running_pace(1,'3:15'))       # '3:15'
print(running_pace(5,'25:00'))      # '5:00'
print(running_pace(15,'75:00'))     # '5:00'
print(running_pace(2.51,'10:43'))   # '4:16'
print(running_pace(4.99,'22:32'))   # '4:30'
