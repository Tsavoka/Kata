# You will be given a string (x) featuring a cat 'C' and a mouse 'm'.
# The rest of the string will be made up of '.'.
# You need to find out if the cat can catch the mouse from it's current
# position. The cat can jump over three characters. So:
# C.....m returns 'Escaped!' <-- more than three characters between
# C...m returns 'Caught!' <-- as there are three characters between the
# two, the cat can jump.

def cat_mouse(x):
    return 'Caught!' if x.strip('.').count('.') < 4 else 'Escaped!'




print(cat_mouse('C....m'))  # "Escaped!")
print(cat_mouse('C..m'))    # "Caught!")
print(cat_mouse('C.....m')) # "Escaped!")
print(cat_mouse('C.m'))     # "Caught!")
print(cat_mouse('m...C'))   # "Caught!")
