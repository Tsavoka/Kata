# This function should take two string parameters: a person's name
# (name) and a quote of theirs (quote), and return a string attributing
# the quote to the person in the following format:
# '[name] said: "[quote]"'
# For example, if name is 'Grae' and 'quote' is 'Practice makes perfect'
# then your function should return the string
# 'Grae said: "Practice makes perfect"'
# Unfortunately, something is wrong with the instructions in the function
# body. Your job is to fix it so the function returns correctly formatted
# quotes.

def quotable(name, quote):
    return '{} said: "{}"'.format(name, quote)




print(quotable('Grae', 'Practice makes perfect'))
# 'Grae said: "Practice makes perfect"'
print(quotable('Dan', 'Get back to work, Grae'))
# 'Dan said: "Get back to work, Grae"'
print(quotable('Alex', 'Python is great fun'))
# 'Alex said: "Python is great fun"'
print(quotable('Bethany', 'Yes, way more fun than R'))
# 'Bethany said: "Yes, way more fun than R"'
print(quotable('Darrell', 'What the heck is this thing?'))
# 'Darrell said: "What the heck is this thing?"'
