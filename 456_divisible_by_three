# A trick I learned in elementary school to determine whether or not a
# number was divisible by three is to add all of the integers in the number
# together and to divide the resulting sum by three. If there is no remainder
# from dividing the sum by three, then the original number is divisible by
# three as well.
# Given a series of digits as a string, determine if the number represented
# by the string is divisible by three.
# Example:
# "123"      -> true
# "8409"     -> true
# "100853"   -> false
# "33333333" -> true
# "7"        -> false
# Try to avoid using the % (modulo) operator.
