# You will be given an array that contains two strings. Your job is to
# create a function that will take those two strings and transpose them,
# so that the strings go from top to bottom instead of left to right.
# e.g. transposeTwoStrings(['Hello','World']);
# should return
# H W  
# e o  
# l r  
# l l  
# o d
# A few things to note:
# There should be one space in between the two characters
# You don't have to modify the case (i.e. no need to change to upper or lower)
# If one string is longer than the other, there should be a space where the
# character would be
