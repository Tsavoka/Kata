# Your job is to figure out the index of which vowel is missing from a
# given string:
# A has an index of 0,
# E has an index of 1,
# I has an index of 2,
# O has an index of 3,
# U has an index of 4.
# Notes: There is no need for string validation and every sentence given
# will contain all vowles but one. Also, you won't need to worry about
# capitals.

let_ind = {'a': 0, 'e': 1, 'i': 2, 'o': 3, 'u': 4}
def absent_vowel(x):
    return let_ind[''.join({'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'} ^ set(re.findall(r'[aeiou]', x)))]




print(absent_vowel("John Doe hs seven red pples under his bsket"))         # 0
print(absent_vowel("Bb Smith sent us six neatly arranged range bicycles")) # 3
