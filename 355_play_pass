# Everyone knows passphrases. One can choose passphrases from poems,
# songs, movies names and so on but frequently they can be guessed due
# to common cultural references. You can get your passphrases stronger
# by different means. One is the following:
# - choose a text in capital letters including or not digits and non
# alphabetic characters,
# - shift each letter by a given number but the transformed letter must be
# a letter (circular shift),
# - replace each digit by its complement to 9,
# - keep such as non alphabetic and non digit characters,
# - downcase each letter in odd position, upcase each letter in even
# position (the first character is in position 0),
# - reverse the whole result.
# Example:
# your text: "BORN IN 2015!", shift 1
# 1 + 2 + 3 -> "CPSO JO 7984!"
# 4 "CpSo jO 7984!"
# 5 "!4897 Oj oSpC"
# With longer passphrases it's better to have a small and easy program.
# Would you write it?
