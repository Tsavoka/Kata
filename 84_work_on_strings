# Your task is to Combine two Strings. But consider the rule...
# By the way you don't have to check errors or incorrect input values,
# everything is ok without bad tricks, only two input strings and as
# result one output string;-)...
# And here's the rule:
# Input Strings a and b: For every character in string a swap the casing
# of every occurrence of the same character in string b. Then do the
# same casing swap with the inputs reversed. Return a single string
# consisting of the changed version of a followed by the changed version
# of b. A char of a is in b regardless if it's in upper or lower case -
# see the testcases too.

def work_on_strings(a,b):
    return ''.join([let_a.swapcase() if b.lower().count(let_a)%2!=0 or b.upper().count(let_a)%2!=0 else let_a for let_a in a] + [let_b.swapcase() if a.lower().count(let_b)%2!=0 or a.upper().count(let_b)%2!=0 else let_b for let_b in b])
