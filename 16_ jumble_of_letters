# Pirates have notorious difficulty with enunciating. They tend 
# to blur all the letters together and scream at people.
# At long last, we need a way to unscramble what these pirates are saying.
# Write a function that will accept a jumble of letters as well as 
# a dictionary, and output a list of words that the pirate might have meant.
# Return matches in the same order as in the dictionary. Return an empty 
# array if there are no matches.
