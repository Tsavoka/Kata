# Given a Divisor and a Bound , Find the largest integer N, Such That,
# Conditions :
# N is divisible by divisor
# N is less than or equal to bound
# N is greater than 0.
# Notes
# The parameters (divisor, bound) passed to the function are only
# positive values.
# It's guaranteed that a divisor is Found.

def max_multiple(divisor, bound):
    return divisor * (bound // divisor)




print(max_multiple(2,7))        # 6
print(max_multiple(3,10))       # 9
print(max_multiple(7,17))       # 14
print(max_multiple(10,50))      # 50
print(max_multiple(37,200))     # 185
print(max_multiple(7,100))      # 98
