# For every good kata idea there seem to be quite a few bad ones!
# In this kata you need to check the provided 2 dimensional array (x) for
# good ideas 'good' and bad ideas 'bad'. If there are one or two good
# ideas, return 'Publish!', if there are more than 2 return 'I smell a
# series!'. If there are no good ideas, as is often the case, return 'Fail!'.
# The sub arrays may not be the same length.
# The solution should be case insensitive (ie good, GOOD and gOOd all count
# as a good idea). All inputs may not be strings.

    arr = sum(type(i)==str and i.lower()=='good' for k in arr for i in k)
    return 'I smell a series!' if (arr > 2) else 'Fail!' if not (arr) else 'Publish!'
