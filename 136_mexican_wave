# In this simple Kata your task is to create a function that turns a
# string into a Mexican Wave. You will be passed a string and you must
# return that string in an array where an uppercase letter is a person
# standing up.
# 1.  The input string will always be lower case but maybe empty.
# 2.  If the character in the string is whitespace then pass over it
# as if it was an empty seat.
# wave("hello") => ["Hello", "hEllo", "heLlo", "helLo", "hellO"]

        else:
            result.append(people[0:y]+people[y:len(people)+1].capitalize())
            y += 1
    return result
