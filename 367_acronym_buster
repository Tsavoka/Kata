# Laura really hates people using acronyms in her office and wants to
# force her colleagues to remove all acronyms before emailing her. She
# wants you to build a system that will edit out all known acronyms or
# else will notify the sender if unknown acronyms are present.
# Any combination of three or more letters in upper case will be considered
# an acronym. Acronyms will not be combined with lowercase letters, such
# as in the case of 'KPIs'. They will be kept isolated as a word/words
# within a string.
# For any string:
# All instances of 'KPI' must become "key performance indicators"
# All instances of 'EOD' must become "the end of the day"
# All instances of 'TBD' must become "to be decided"
# All instances of 'WAH' must become "work at home"
# All instances of 'IAM' must become "in a meeting"
# All instances of 'OOO' must become "out of office"
# All instances of 'NRN' must become "no reply necessary"
# All instances of 'CTA' must become "call to action"
# All instances of 'SWOT' must become "strengths, weaknesses, opportunities
# and threats"
# If there are any unknown acronyms in the string, Laura wants you to return
# only the message:
# '[acronym] is an acronym. I do not like acronyms. Please remove them from
# your email.'
# So if the acronym in question was 'BRB', you would return the string:
# 'BRB is an acronym. I do not like acronyms. Please remove them from your
# email.'
# If there is more than one unknown acronym in the string, return only the
# first in your answer.
# If all acronyms can be replaced with full words according to the above,
# however, return only the altered string.
# If this is the case, ensure that sentences still start with capital
# letters. '!' or '?' will not be used.
