# Your task is to write an update for a lottery machine. Its current
# version produces a sequence of random letters and integers (passed as
# a string to the function). Your code must filter out all letters and
# return unique integers as a string, in their order of first appearance.
# If there are no integers in the string return "One more run!"

def lottery(s):
    nums = [i for i in s if i.isdigit()]
    result = ''
    for num in nums:
        if num not in result:
            result += num
    return result if result else "One more run!"




print(lottery("wQ8Hy0y5m5oshQPeRCkG"))  # "805"
print(lottery("ffaQtaRFKeGIIBIcSJtg"))  # "One more run!"
