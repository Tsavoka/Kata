# The goal of this Kata is to reduce the passed integer to a single
# digit (if not already) by converting the number to binary, taking the
# sum of the binary digits, and if that sum is not a single digit then
# repeat the process.
# - n will be an integer such that 0 < n < 10^20
# - If the passed integer is already a single digit there is no need to
# reduce
# For example given 5665 the function should return 5:
# 5665 --> (binary) 1011000100001
# 1011000100001 --> (sum of binary digits) 5

def single_digit(n):
    while n > 9:
        n = bin(n).count('1')
    return n




print(single_digit(5665))       # 5
print(single_digit(123456789))  # 1
