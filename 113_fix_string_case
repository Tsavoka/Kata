# In this Kata, you will be given a string that may have mixed uppercase
# and lowercase letters and your task is to convert that string to
# either lowercase only or uppercase only based on:
# - make as few changes as possible.
# - if the string contains equal number of uppercase and lowercase
# letters, convert the string to lowercase.
