# Given a number, insert duplicate digits on both sides of all
# digits which appear in a group of 1.
# Worked Example
# 22733 âžž 2277733
# The number can be split into groups 22, 7, and 33.
# 7 appears on its own.
# Put 7s on both sides to create 777.
# Put the numbers together and return the result.
# All tests will include positive integers.
