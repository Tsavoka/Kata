# The borrowers are tiny tiny fictional people. As tiny tiny people they
# have to be sure they aren't spotted, or more importantly, stepped on.
# As a result, the borrowers talk very very quietly. They find that capitals
# and punctuation of any sort lead them to raise their voices and put them
# in danger.
# The young borrowers have begged their parents to stop using caps and
# punctuation.
# Change the input text s to new borrower speak. Help save the next generation!
