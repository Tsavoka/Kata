# You are given a string of words (x), for each word within the string you
# need to turn the word 'inside out'. By this I mean the internal letters
# will move out, and the external letters move toward the centre.
# If the word is even length, all letters will move. If the length is odd,
# you are expected to leave the 'middle' letter of the word where it is.
# An example should clarify:
# 'taxi' would become 'atix' 'taxis' would become 'atxsi'
