# You've just finished writing the last chapter for your novel when a
# virus suddenly infects your document. It has swapped the 'i's and
# 'e's in 'ei' words and capitalised random letters. Write a function
# which will:
# a) remove the spelling errors in 'ei' words. (Example of 'ei' words:
# their, caffeine, deceive, weight)
# b) only capitalise the first letter of each sentence. Make sure the
# rest of the sentence is in lower case.
# Example: He haD iEght ShOTs of CAffIEne. --> He had eight shots of
# caffeine.

def proofread(string):
    return '. '.join(i.capitalize() for i in string.lower().replace('ie', 'ei').split('. '))
