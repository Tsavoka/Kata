# In English, all words at the begining of a sentence should begin with a
# capital letter.
# You will be given a paragraph that does not use capital letters. Your job
# is to capitalise the first letter of the first word of each sentence.
# For example,
# "hello. my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die."
# "Hello. My name is inigo montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
# You may assume:
# there will be no punctuation besides full stops and spaces
# all but the last full stop will be followed by a space and at least one word

def fix(paragraph):
    return '. '.join(i.capitalize() for i in paragraph.split('. '))




print(fix(""))      # ""
print(fix("hi."))   # "Hi."
print(fix("hello. my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. \
prepare to die."))
# "Hello. My name is inigo montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
