# ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with
# the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is an example of the
# Caesar cipher.
# Create a function that takes a string and returns the string ciphered
# with Rot13. If there are numbers or special characters included in the
# string, they should be returned as they are. Only letters from the
# latin/english alphabet should be shifted, like in the original Rot13
# "implementation".
# Please note that using encode is considered cheating.
