# Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore
# delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output
# should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known
# as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case).
# Examples
# "the-stealth-warrior" gets converted to "theStealthWarrior"
# "The_Stealth_Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"
