# The goal of this Kata is to write a function that will receive an array
# of strings as its single argument, then the strings are each processed and
# sorted (in desending order) based on the length of the single longest
# sub-string of contiguous vowels ( aeiouAEIOU ) that may be contained
# within the string. The strings may contain letters, numbers, special
# characters, uppercase, lowercase, whitespace, and there may be (often will
# be) multiple sub-strings of contiguous vowels. We are only interested in
# the single longest sub-string of vowels within each string, in the input
# array.
# Example:
# str1 = "what a beautiful day today"
# str2 = "it's okay, but very breezy"
# When the strings are sorted, str1 will be first as its longest sub-string
# of contiguous vowels "eau" is of length 3, while str2 has as its longest
# sub-string of contiguous vowels "ee", which is of length 2.
# If two or more strings in the array have maximum sub-strings of the same
# length, then the strings should remain in the order in which they were
# found in the orginal array.
