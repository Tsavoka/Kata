# Given a non-negative integer, return an array / a list of the individual
# digits in order.
# Examples:
# 123 => [1,2,3]
# 1 => [1]
# 8675309 => [8,6,7,5,3,0,9]

def digitize(n):
    return list(map(int, str(n)))




print(digitize(123))        # [1,2,3]
print(digitize(1))          # [1]
print(digitize(0))          # [0]
print(digitize(1230))       # [1,2,3, 0]
print(digitize(8675309))    # [8,6,7,5,3,0,9]
