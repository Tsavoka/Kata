# You know how sometimes you write the the same word twice in a sentence,
# but then don't notice that it happened? For example, you've been
# distracted for a second. Did you notice that *"the"* is doubled in the
# first sentence of this description?
# As as aS you can see, it's not easy to spot those errors, especially
# if words differ in case, like *"as"* at the beginning of the sentence.
# Write a function that counts the number of sections repeating the same
# word (case insensitive). The occurence of two or more equal words next
# after each other count as one.
