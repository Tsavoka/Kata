# A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater
# than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and
# itself.
# You will be given the lower and upper limits: the program
# will look for any prime number that exists between the
# lower limit to the upper limit (included).
# Your objective is to sum all the primes between the given
# limits.
# If the limits are primes, then they are included
# -100000 <= lower < upper <= 100000
# If lower is greater than upper, it should return 0
# Example
# You are given a lower limit of 4 and an upper limit of 20.
# So the prime numbers from 4 to 20 will be: 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,
# 19
# and if you add them up, the result will be 72.
