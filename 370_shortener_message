# SMS messages are limited to 160 characters. It tends to be irritating,
# especially when freshly written message is 164 characters long.
# Your task is to shorten the message to 160 characters, starting from end,
# by replacing spaces with camelCase, as much as necessary.
# If all the spaces are replaced but the resulting message is still longer
# than 160 characters, just return that resulting message.
# Example 1:
# Original message (169 chars):
# No one expects the Spanish Inquisition! Our chief weapon is surprise,
# fear and surprise; two chief weapons, fear, surprise, and ruthless
# efficiency! And that will be it.
# Shortened message (160 chars):
# No one expects the Spanish Inquisition! Our chief weapon is surprise,
# fear and surprise; two chief weapons, fear,Surprise,AndRuthlessEfficiency!
# AndThatWillBeIt.
# Example 2:
