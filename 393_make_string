# In this exercise, a string is passed to a method and a new string has to
# be returned with the first character of each word in the string.
# For example:
# "This Is A Test" ==> "TIAT"
# Strings will only contain letters and spaces, with exactly 1 space between
# words, and no leading/trailing spaces.
