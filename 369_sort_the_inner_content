# You have to sort the inner content of every word of a string in
# descending order.
# The inner content is the content of a word without first and the last char.
# Some examples:
# "sort the inner content in descending order"  -->  "srot the inner
# ctonnet in dsnnieedcg oredr"
# "wait for me"        -->  "wiat for me"
# "this kata is easy"  -->  "tihs ktaa is esay"
# Words are made up of lowercase letters.
# The string will never be null and will never be empty. In C/C++ the
# string is always nul-terminated.
# Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)
# I have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!
