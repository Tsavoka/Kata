# Create a function longer that accepts a string and sorts the words in
# it based on their respective lengths in an ascending order. If there
# are two words of the same lengths, sort them alphabetically. Look at
# the examples below for more details.
# longer("Another Green World") => Green World Another
# longer("Darkness on the edge of Town") => of on the Town edge Darkness
# longer("Have you ever Seen the Rain") => the you Have Rain Seen ever
# Assume that only only Alphabets will be entered as the input. Uppercase
# characters have priority over lowercase characters. That is,
# longer("hello Hello") => Hello hello

def longer(s):
    return ' '.join(sorted(sorted(s.split()), key=len))




print(longer("Another Green World"))            # "Green World Another"
print(longer("Darkness on the edge of Town"))   # "of on the Town edge Darkness"
print(longer("Have you ever Seen the Rain"))    # "the you Have Rain Seen ever"
print(longer("Like a Rolling Stone"))           # "a Like Stone Rolling"
print(longer("This will be our Year"))          # "be our This Year will"
print(longer("hello Hello"))                    # "Hello hello"
