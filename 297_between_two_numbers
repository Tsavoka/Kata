# Build a function that can get all the integers between two given numbers.
# Example: (2,9)
# Should give you this output back: [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ]
# If start_num is the same as end_num, return an empty sequence.

def function(start_num, end_num): 
    return [i for i in range(start_num+1, end_num)]




print(function(2,9))    # [3,4,5,6,7,8]
print(function(6,8))    # [7]
print(function(2,9))    # [3,4,5,6,7,8]
