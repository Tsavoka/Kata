# Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests)
# and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that,
# when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items
# should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language)
# like so: (index1, index2).
# For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any
# valid solutions will be accepted.
# The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or
# greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the
# sum of two different items from that array).
# two_sum([1, 2, 3], 4) # returns [0, 2] or [2, 0]

def two_sum(numbers, target):
    for i in numbers:
        for k, j in enumerate(numbers):
            if numbers.index(i) != k and i + j == target:
                return [numbers.index(i), k]

    


print(two_sum([1,2,3], 4))                  # [0,2]
print(two_sum([1234,5678,9012], 14690))     # [1,2]
print(two_sum([2,2,3], 4))                  # [0,1]
print(two_sum([0,0], 0))                    # [0,1]
