# Write a function that returns the count of characters that have to be
# removed in order to get a string with no consecutive repeats.
# Note: This includes any characters
# Examples
# 'abbbbc'  => 'abc'    #  answer: 3
# 'abbcca'  => 'abca'   #  answer: 2
# 'ab cca'  => 'ab ca'  #  answer: 1

    rez = txt[0]
    counter = 0
    for i in txt[1:]:
        if i == rez[-1]:
            counter += 1
        else:
            rez += i
    return counter




print(count_repeats('abbc'))    # 1
print(count_repeats('abbcca'))  # 2
print(count_repeats('ab cca'))  # 1
