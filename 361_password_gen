# You need to write a password generator that meets the following criteria:
# 6 - 20 characters long
# contains at least one lowercase letter
# contains at least one uppercase letter
# contains at least one number
# contains only alphanumeric characters (no special characters)
# Return the random password as a string.
# Note: "randomness" is checked by counting the characters used in the
# generated passwords - all characters should have less than 50% occurance.
# Based on extensive tests, the normal rate is around 35%.
