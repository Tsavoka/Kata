# Description:
# Create a function that returns a christmas tree of the correct height.
# For example:
# height = 5 should return:
#     *    
#    ***   
#   *****  
#  ******* 
# *********
# Height passed is always an integer between 0 and 100.
# Use \n for newlines between each line.
# Pad with spaces so each line is the same length. The last line having
# only stars, no spaces.

def christmas_tree(height):
    rez = []
    dot = height - 1
    star = 1
    for i in range(height):
        rez.append('{0}{1}{0}'.format(' '*dot, '*'*star))
        star += 2
        dot -= 1
    return '\n'.join(rez)
