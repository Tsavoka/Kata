# You get a list of integers, and you have to write a function mirror
# that returns the "mirror" (or symmetric) version of this list: i.e.
# the middle element is the greatest, then the next greatest on both
# sides, the the next greatest, and so on...
# The list will always consist of integers in range -1000..1000 and will
# vary in size between 0 and 10000. Your function should not mutate the
# input array, and this will be tested (where applicable). Notice that
# the returned list will always be of odd size, since there will always
# be a definitive middle element.

    return sorted(arr)[:-1] + sorted(arr, reverse=True)

print(mirror([1, 3, 2]))            # [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
