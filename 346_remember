# Write a function that takes a string and returns an array of the
# repeated characters (letters, numbers, whitespace) in the string.
# If a charater is repeated more than once, only show it once in the
# result array.
# Characters should be shown by the order of their first repetition.
# Note that this may be different from the order of first appearance
# of the character.
# Characters are case sensitive.
# Examples:
# remember("apple") => returns ["p"]
# remember("apPle") => returns []          # no repeats, "p" != "P"
# remember("pippi") => returns ["p","i"]   # show "p" only once
# remember('Pippi') => returns ["p","i"]   # "p" is repeated first

def remember(str_):
    rez = []
    for k, i in enumerate(str_):
        if i in str_[:k] and i not in rez:
            rez.append(i)      
    return rez




print(remember('apple'))                        # ["p"]
print(remember("apPle"))                        # []
print(remember("pippi"))                        # ["p", "i"]
print(remember('Pippi'))                        # ["p", "i"]
print(remember("limbojackassin the garden"))    # ["a", "s", "i", " ", "e", "n"]
print(remember("11pinguin"))                    # ["1", "i", "n"]
