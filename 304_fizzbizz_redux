# The galactic games have begun!
# It's the galactic games! Beings of all worlds come together to compete
# in several interesting sports, like nroogring, fredling and buzzing (the
# beefolks love the last one). However, there's also the traditional
# marathon run.
# Unfortunately, there have been cheaters in the last years, and the
# committee decided to place sensors on the track. Committees being
# committees, they've come up with the following rule:
# A sensor should be placed every 3 and 5 meters from the start, e.g. at
# 3m, 5m, 6m, 9m, 10m, 12m, 15m, 18mâ€¦.
# Since you're responsible for the track, you need to buy those sensors.
# Even worse, you don't know how long the track will be! And since there
# might be more than a single track, and you can't be bothered to do all
# of this by hand, you decide to write a program instead.
# Task
# Return the sum of the multiples of 3 and 5 below a number. Being the
# galactic games, the tracks can get rather large, so your solution should
# work for really large numbers (greater than 1,000,000).

def solution(number):
    number -= 1
    th = 3*(number//3)*(1+number//3)//2
    fi = 5*(number//5)*(1+number//5)//2
    pt = 15*(number//15)*(1+number//15)//2
    return th + fi - pt
