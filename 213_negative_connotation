# You will be given a string with sets of characters, (i.e. words),
# seperated by between one and three spaces (inclusive).
# Looking at the first letter of each word (case insensitive-"A"
# and "a" should be treated the same), you need to determine whether
# it falls into the positive/first half of the alphabet ("a"-"m") or
# the negative/second half ("n"-"z").
# Return True if there are more (or equal) positive words than negative
# words, False otherwise.
