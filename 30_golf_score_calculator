# I have the par value for each hole on a golf course and my stroke score on each 
# hole. I have them stored as strings, because I wrote them down on a sheet of 
# paper. Right now, I'm using those strings to calculate my golf score by hand: 
# take the difference between my actual score and the par of the hole, and add up 
# the results for all 18 holes.
# Ex: If I took 7 shots on a hole where the par was 5, my score would be: 7 - 5 = 2
# Complete the function which accepts two strings and calculates the golf score of 
# a game. Both strings will be of length 18, and each character in the string will 
# be a number between 1 and 9 inclusive.
