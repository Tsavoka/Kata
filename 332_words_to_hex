# Gary likes pictures but he also likes words and reading. He has had a
# desire for a long time to see what words and books would look like if
# they could be seen as images.
# For this task you are required to take a continuous string that can
# consist of any combination of words or characters and then convert the
# words that make up this string into hexadecimal values that could then
# be read as colour values.
# A word is defined as a sequence of ASCII characters between two white
# space characters or the first or last word of a sequence of words.
# Each word will represent a hexadecimal value by taking the first three
# letters of each word and find the ASCII character code for each
# character. This will then give you one hexadecimal value that represents
# the colours red, green or blue. You will then combine these values into
# one readable RGB hexadecimal value, e.g. #ffffff.
# If your word consists of less than 3 letters, you should use the
# hexidecimal value 00, ie "It" would return a value #497400.
# Your answer should be an array of hexadecimal values that correspond to
# each word that made up your original string.
