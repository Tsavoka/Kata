# Factorials are often used in probability and are used as an introductory
# problem for looping constructs. In this kata you will be summing together
# multiple factorials.
# In this kata you will be given a list of values that you must first find
# the factorial, and then return their sum.
# For example if you are passed the list [4, 6] the equivalent mathematical
# expression would be 4! + 6! which would equal 744.
# Note: Assume that all values in the list are positive integer values > 0
# and each value in the list is unique.
# Also, you must write your own implementation of factorial, as you cannot
# use the built-in math.factorial() method.

def fac(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return fac(n-1) * n

def sum_factorial(lst):
    return sum(fac(i) for i in lst)


print(sum_factorial([4,6]))     # 744
print(sum_factorial([5,4,1]))   # 145
