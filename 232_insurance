# Create a Javascript function, called insurance(), that computes the
# cost of renting a car. The function takes 3 arguments: the age of the
# renter, the size of the car, and the number days for the rental.
# The function should return an integer number of the calculated total
# cost of the rental.
# Age (integer) : There is a daily charge of $10 if the driver is under 25
# Car Size (string) : There may be an additional daily charge based on
# the car size:
# car size	surcharge
# "economy"	$0
# "medium"	$10
# "full-size"	$15
# Rental Days (integer) : There is a base daily charge of $50 for
# renting a car. Simply multiply the one day cost by the number of days
# the car is rented in order to get the full cost.
# Note: Negative rental days should return 0 cost. Any other car size
# NOT listed should come with a same surcharge as the "full-size", $15.

def insurance(age, size, num_of_days): 
    rez = 50
    if age < 25:
        rez += 10
    if size == 'economy':
        rez += 0
    elif size == 'medium':
        rez += 10
    else:
        rez += 15
    return (rez * num_of_days) if num_of_days > 0 else 0




print(insurance(18, "medium", 7))       # 490
print(insurance(30,"full-size",30))     # 1950
print(insurance(21,"economy",-10))      # 0
print(insurance(42,"my custom car",7))  # 455
