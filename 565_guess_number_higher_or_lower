# We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
# I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
# Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I 
# picked is higher or lower than your guess.
# You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three
# possible results:
# -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
# 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
# 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
# Return the number that I picked.
